Yes, there is a more secure and managed alternative to a bastion host in AWS. You can use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager instead of setting up and maintaining a bastion host.

## Session Manager allows you to:
- Connect to your EC2 instances without any public IP addresses
- Avoid opening inbound SSH ports (port 22)
- Manage access with IAM policies instead of SSH keys
- Automatically log all sessions to CloudWatch Logs or S3 for auditing
